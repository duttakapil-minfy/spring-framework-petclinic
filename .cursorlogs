BACKEND API ANALYSIS:

1. API PATH ISSUE:
   - The error shows a 503 for "/api" endpoint
   - This suggests the API base path is configured but the endpoint isn't properly mapped or available

2. SWAGGER CONFIGURATION:
   - Swagger/OpenAPI is mentioned in the implementation summary
   - The README mentions accessing Swagger at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   - No visible SpringDoc or Springfox configuration in the provided code snippets

3. SPRING BOOT VS SPRING MVC:
   - The project appears to be using traditional Spring MVC (not Spring Boot)
   - Running with "mvn jetty:run-war" instead of Spring Boot's embedded server
   - This affects how Swagger and API endpoints are configured

4. COMPILATION ERROR FIXED:
   - The protected access issue in Pet.setOwner() was fixed
   - But there may be other configuration issues preventing proper API initialization

5. MOST LIKELY ISSUES:
   - Missing or incorrect servlet mapping for the REST controllers
   - Missing or incomplete Swagger configuration
   - Jetty server configuration issue
   - Web application context path configuration issue

6. RECOMMENDED FIXES:
   - Check web.xml for proper servlet mappings
   - Verify Swagger dependencies and configuration
   - Try accessing API with different paths: /petclinic/api, /api/owners, etc.
   - Check server logs for more detailed error information
   - Consider adding a proper SpringDoc OpenAPI configuration class
